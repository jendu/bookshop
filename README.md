Bookshop implementation using JDK 14.0.1 and JavaFX 14.0.2.1.

Allows for management of books and discounts (UI for this is shown below).

### How To Run:
1. I used IntelliJ IDEA.

    If using IntelliJ IDEA to run, the following may be useful:

    1. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html#add-javafx-lib
    2. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html#vm-options

    If you cannot compile my program regardless, you can still run my executable jar found in /out/artifacts/bookshop_jar.

2. The username and password required to access the manage (add/remove/update) books and discounts page as the authorised bookkeeper was chosen for simplicity (and not security) and are:

    Username: Admin

    Password: Password
